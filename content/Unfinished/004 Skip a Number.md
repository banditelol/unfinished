![[004 Skip a Number.png|300]]

Writing in public is hard for me. Especially since I have unreasonable standard about how good am I on it. Even the previous sentence took me a while to choose between using "how good am I" or "how good I am". I definitely don't want to be perceived as incompetent in conveying idea, but at what costs?

As there are no silver bullet, there are context to rules. For content on this part of my site, I think it's fine to follow above rules because of the seriousness (or lack thereof) in this site. But if I want to publish in my blog, give talks, or create course I definitely need to be more careful and curate first before publishing.

So, I'll just skip number 3 for now (it's quite hard to write unexpectedly) and just publish this first instead :)
