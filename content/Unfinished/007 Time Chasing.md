A bit while after working on my first job, I remember [[üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èSeterhen Akbar (Saska)]] our CEO shows us an app that automatically track our time. It feels incredible at that time, because our company worked on improving gig economy ecosystem and one of the main issue here is most employer want to get report about the time spent[^1]. Since then I've fallen into the rabbit hole of finding tools for make tracking time easier multiple times. And often with different goals in mind. Here's a part review, and a part journal about how some products that I came across.
## Rize-ing Expectation[^2]

Who doesn't love pretty dashboard? Especially one with dark mode?

Rize is the newest tool that I discovered in this space. The dashboard, marketing and the reviews it got (I'm biased since I )
