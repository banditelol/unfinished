A blank canvas really is daunting. This is an example of that. It took me a whole night of writing and deleting the same sentences (with subtle differences) before I arrived here. And even then, it took me like weeks to just finished this paragraph.

Then I realized, this form of writing.

This Unfinished Project.

Is not for me to write something for You.

It's something that I write to help me to think better, and I'm putting it out here because I think it might be of some value to You.

This is not a Blog, Publication, or a Social Media post.

If you want to read anything for you, go to [my blog](adityarp.com) instead. But if you find what I wrote interesting and would like to pickle more out of my brain. Then continue down this path.

Welcome the the state of being that's unclear, and possibly changing. And welcome to the (un)finished.
