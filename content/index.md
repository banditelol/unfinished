title: ðŸ¤” Hi?
---
I'm [Aditya Rachman Putra](https://adityarp.com) or [Banditelol](https://github.com/banditelol), welcome to (un)Finished! 

Sometimes I felt writing was hard. Especially when I want to publish writing to public, I often felt crippled and ended up not publishing it at all. This website is daily notes and my experimentation notes that will be published daily with aim to be publishing something every day. Whether finished or not, so it's in a way to borrow from [[Rafal Pastuszak]]'s [Untested](https://untested.sonnet.io/index) the un here is not about not finished but in a lull state between working and finished, but was put out there anyway. So expect things to change but I won't explicitly mention if something is changed, as this state is unstable. 

This experiment is a way for me to face 2024 with something different. I want to put myself out there and also I'd like to give back to the discourse of my domain. So this is it. For now I'll aim to publish 101 experimentation notes here by August 2024, so let's see how it goes :)

Oh! and as I worked on this on my Obsidian using Quartz, expect some broken link and unfinished thoughts ðŸ™ƒ
